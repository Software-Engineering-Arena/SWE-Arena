# SWE-Arena: An Interactive Platform for Evaluating Foundation Models in Software Engineering

Welcome to **SWE-Arena**, an open-source platform designed for evaluating software engineering-focused foundation models (FMs), particularly large language models (LLMs). SWE-Arena benchmarks models in iterative, context-rich workflows that are characteristic of software engineering (SE) tasks.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Round Conversational Workflows**: Evaluate models through extended, context-dependent interactions that mirror real-world SE processes.
- **RepoChat Integration**: Automatically inject repository context (issues, commits, PRs) into conversations for more realistic evaluations.
- **Advanced Evaluation Metrics**: Assess models using a comprehensive suite of metrics including:
  - Traditional metrics: Elo score and average win rate
  - Network-based metrics: Eigenvector centrality, PageRank score
  - Community detection: Newman modularity score
  - Consistency score: Quantify model determinism and reliability through self-play matches
- **Transparent, Open-Source Leaderboard**: View real-time model rankings across diverse SE workflows with full transparency.

## Why SWE-Arena?

Existing evaluation frameworks (e.g. [LMArena](https://lmarena.ai)) often don't address the complex, iterative nature of SE tasks. SWE-Arena fills critical gaps by:

- Supporting context-rich, multi-turn evaluations to capture iterative workflows
- Integrating repository-level context through RepoChat to simulate real-world development scenarios
- Providing multidimensional metrics for nuanced model comparisons
- Focusing on the full breadth of SE tasks beyond just code generation

## How It Works

1. **Submit a Prompt**: Sign in and input your SE-related task (optional: include a repository URL for RepoChat context)
2. **Compare Responses**: Two anonymous models provide responses to your query
3. **Continue the Conversation**: Test contextual understanding over multiple rounds
4. **Vote**: Choose the better model at any point, with ability to re-assess after multiple turns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) account
- Basic understanding of software engineering workflows

### Usage

1. Navigate to the [SWE-Arena platform](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SE-Arena/Software-Engineering-Arena)
2. Sign in with your Hugging Face account
3. Enter your SE task prompt (optionally include a repository URL for RepoChat)
4. Engage in multi-round interactions and vote on model performance

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can help:

1. **Submit SE Tasks**: Share your real-world SE problems to enrich our evaluation dataset
2. **Report Issues**: Found a bug or have a feature request? Open an issue in this repository
3. **Enhance the Codebase**: Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request

## Privacy Policy

Your interactions are anonymized and used solely for improving SWE-Arena and FM benchmarking. By using SWE-Arena, you agree to our Terms of Service.

## Future Plans

- **Analysis of Real-World SE Workloads**: Identify common patterns and challenges in user-submitted tasks
- **Multi-Round Evaluation Metrics**: Develop specialized metrics for assessing model adaptation over successive turns
- **Enhanced Community Engagement**: Enable broader participation through voting and contributions
- **Expanded FM Coverage**: Include domain-specific and multimodal foundation models
- **Advanced Context Compression**: Integrate techniques like [LongRope](https://github.com/microsoft/LongRoPE) and [SelfExtend](https://github.com/datamllab/LongLM) to manage long-term memory
